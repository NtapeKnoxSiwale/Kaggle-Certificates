# Geospatial Analysis

After I had a `Pula Data Analyst Assessment Test`, I did not manage to finish solving the Geospatial question in the test because I had no idea what `Geospatial Analysis` was but after finding the course on Kaggle I wanted to earn the micro-certifcate that way wheneve I find any geospatial data again I will make sure I'm be able to solve it.

# Lessons

> Geospatial Analysis is used for creating interactive maps, and discovering patterns in geospatial data.

The certificate contains the following lessons;

1. [Your First Map](/01-Your-First-Map.ipynb) : <span>Getting started with plotting in GeoPandas.</span>
2. [Coordinate Reference Systems](/02-Coordinate-Reference-Systems.ipynb) : <span style="color">It's pretty amazing that we can represent the Earth's surface in 2 dimensions!</span>
3. [Interactive Maps](/03-Interactive-Maps.ipynb) : <span>Learn how to make interactive heatmaps, choropleth maps, and more!</span>
4. [Manipulating Geospatial Data](/04-Manipulating-Geospatial-Data.ipynb) : <span style="color">Find locations with just the name of a place. And, learn how to join data based on spatial relationships.</span>
5. [Proximity Analysis](/05-Proximity-Analysis.ipynb) : <span>Measure distance, and explore neighboring points on a map.</span>

All the course materials are availbale on [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com).
